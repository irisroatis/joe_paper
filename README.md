# Categorical Encoding as Joint Optimisation in Predictive Modelling

This repository contains the code for the paper "Categorical Encoding as Joint Optimisation in Predictive Modelling" by Iris-Ioana Roatis, Niall Adams, and Edward AK Cohen.

Python Scripts:
- plotting_motivating_example.py: Generates the plots for the motivating example from the paper's introduction. - Produces Fig 1.


- binary_classification_real.py: Runs the binary classification experiments on real-world datasets.
- plot_results_binary_real.py: Generates the plots for the real-world binary classification experiment results. (results from binary_classification_real.py needed) - Produces Fig 7b and 9.
- binary_classification_synthetic_noint.py: Runs binary classification experiments on synthetic datasets with no interaction terms.
- binary_classification_synthetic_int.py: Runs binary classification experiments on synthetic datasets that include interaction terms.
- plotting_binary_synthetic.py: Generates plots for the synthetic binary classification results. (results from  binary_classification_synthetic_noint.py or binary_classification_synthetic_int.py needed) - Produces Fig 6.


- regression_real.py: Runs regression experiments on real-world datasets.
- plot_real_regression.py: Generates the plots for the real-world regression experiment results. (results from regression_real.py needed) - Produces Fig 7a and 8.
- regression_synthetic_noint.py: Runs regression experiments on synthetic datasets with no interaction terms.
- regression_synthetic_int.py: Runs regression experiments on synthetic datasets that include interaction terms.
- plotting_regression_synthetic.py: Generates plots for the synthetic regression results. (results from regression_synthetic_noint.py or regression_synthetic_int.py needed) - Produces Fig 5.
